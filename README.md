- CMSI2130 Homework 2: Utilizes alphabeta pruning and Adversarial search to decide best possible move against an optimal opponent.
- CMSI2130 Homework 3: Utilizes dynamic programming to guess a secret word using edit distance and a list of top-down transformations to turn one string into another. Useful in real life circumstances when spell-checking.
